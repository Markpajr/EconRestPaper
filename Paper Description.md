An Analysis of the Relationship between Producer Price Indexes and Restaurant Industry Stock Values, with statistical testing conducted with R.
Testing done included model misspecification, heteroscedasticity, multicollinearity, omitted variable bias, and autocorrelation.
This was my first exploration into writing code for R, and sparked my interest in its possibilites.

Abstract
Due to constantly changing food prices, in this paper I’ve explored the extent
producer price index by commodity for food items affects restaurant stock values.
My findings resulted in the determination that my model suffered from violating
many assumptions, though it still has the potential to show significance. With a
working model, this significance could be used to show relationships between
restaurant stock price and PPI, allowing for a new way to understand stock prices.
